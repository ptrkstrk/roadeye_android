Android app notifying the driver about nearby traffic signs. The app is a part of a traffic sign detection system developed for my bachelor thesis. Real-time detection is performed on a Jetson Nano platform and the driver is informed about signs through the app. The detection module is in the roadeye_jetson repository. The app requires a phone with Android 8.0 or higher with Bluetooth support.
